# OpenSky Intro
OpenSky is an free public API providing a variety of flight information data. The two API requests that are interesting for this project is 'Arrivals by Airport' and 'Departures by Airport'. Using these endpoints we can select a few airports and compare the frequency of arrivals and departures for these airports. The data of these endpoints is updated over night. 

## Limitations
- A time interval can be selected from the API but it can not be longer than 7 days
- Data is updated every night
