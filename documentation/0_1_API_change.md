During the development of the pipeline I made the mistake of using up all of my api requests for the free aviationstack api instead of using sample data. When looking around for solutions I found the AeroDataBox API. It does cost 1 dollar per month but this will give me 300 requests instead of the 100 free ones. In addition to this the information is more detailed and it could provide more useful information on the dashboard. Therefore I decided to put in the effort to change the API I'm using.
